# Use of reviews from App Stores to Identify and Classify Requirements using Natural Language Processing
This repository introduces part of the material used in the Undergraduate Research project. It represents the second task: Classify Requirements. 

## Identify Requirements
The first task: Identify Requirements will not be seen here, but in other repository: [available here](https://github.com/BruNamie/RE-BERT). And the results obtained there will be used for the task introduced here. Also, that repository was based on another project: [available here](https://github.com/adailtonaraujo/RE-BERT).

## Classify Requirements
The material used and introduced here is based in other project: "A Practical User Feedback Classifier for Software Quality Characteristics" by Rubens dos Santos, Karina Villela, Diego Toralles Avila and Lucineia Heloisa Thom. The original repository is [available here](https://github.com/knightoftheshadows/reviewsClassification) and the repository with some contributions for a better understanding and study is [available here](https://github.com/BruNamie/reviewsClassification). 
Thus, the material presented here has adaptations to be able to use the outputs of the previous model and to use the Cross-Validation technique according to "RE-BERT: Automatic Extraction of Software Requirements from App Reviews using BERT Language Model" by Adailton Ferreira de Ara√∫jo and Ricardo Marcondes Marcacini.
