It's good but we receive unecessary notifications on the phone;_Label_Zero
Though I wish there was a way to quickly scroll up to the top;_Label_Zero
Pradyut: I don't like this app because this app take several time;_Label_Zero
There is no the top bar.;_Label_Zero
I couldn't see it.;_Label_Zero
Can you stop making twitter freaking refresh everytime i go down the timeline and forcing me up to the top???;_Label_Zero
I uninstall it and install it many times but i can't tweet or re-tweet;_Label_Zero
I still can't watch videos even though I updated my twitter;_Label_Zero
It will not let me install it base on an installation error.;_Label_Zero
Love twitter and the app is amazing can check it whenever I am and also tweet on the go :-D;_Label_Zero
a few times later ，i cant find where’s my top bar;_Label_Zero
This app is the way I access Twitter most often.;_Label_Zero
Videos won't load at all, please fix.;_Label_Perf
I love twitter.;_Label_Zero
FIX THE LASTEST UPDATE PLEASEEEEE;_Label_Zero
This app locks keyboard to screen and requires restart.;_Label_Perf
Will reinstall when fixed.;_Label_Perf
even can't view my own timeline;_Label_Zero
My fr7ends told me its better than the other social medias but when i make my first account then follow and twit it says your account is susspended....;_Label_Zero
Timeline keeps jumping to the top and hours of tweets get lost.;_Label_Zero
Twitter ignores me every time I file this issue.;_Label_Zero
The list doesn't appear anymore :(;_Label_Zero
Pls add one function to get back backup code...I will give 5 stars;_Label_Zero
I am totally disappointed with this update trends are showing wrong side & we can not easily back on the top when we reed tweets;_Label_Zero
I  finally ttx to the Harry styles;_Label_Zero
The subs on the app is right.;_Label_Zero
Thabks for making it,!;_Label_Zero
I almost liked it but when i downloaded it, i tried to open my account.;_Label_Perf
when i typed my account and pressed enter.;_Label_Zero
It says 'error occurred when logging in.;_Label_Perf
I can't open my Account.;_Label_Perf
This does not download;_Label_Perf
Something to stay in touch with the real world;_Label_Zero
"Yes this is a nice app but come on, I mean, it updates every day or two and the update is just ""bugs fixed"" I'm sick and tired of that.";_Label_Perf
Do it at least once a week or if it's a huge update.;_Label_Zero
I don't get push notifications and also can't watch some videos.;_Label_Zero
It's rare if a video actually works.;_Label_Perf
Pause my music when I view a GIF.;_Label_Zero
When it refreshes content, it disregards what you are doing (ie scrolling, viewing a tweet) and automatically brings you to the top without warning.;_Label_Zero
It's working fine but it doesn't let me set a banner.;_Label_Perf
I cant see any photos that people tweet and where did the top bar go??;_Label_Zero
There is no option to switch from taking a photo to a video, why this is happen?;_Label_Zero
Just cuz there always has to be a negative rating but this app is awesome;_Label_Zero
Wtf....going on, I can't see the  photos;_Label_Zero
Frustrating it updates so often & only vague descriptions of what is in the updates.;_Label_Perf
Thanks for the quick camera fix;_Label_Zero
I cant add filtets w/ my pics with the lates version using my galaxy y pls fix this!;_Label_Zero
I love twitter;_Label_Zero
I like the app overall its just that sometimes notifications take a while to come through.;_Label_Zero
I lost the updated twitter when I logged out my account.;_Label_Zero
If it can do the push notification as well on the locked phone would be really great.;_Label_Zero
Talking on Android phone.;_Label_Zero
I have to pay RM1 a week to receive validation code for my phone?;_Label_Zero
Can't follow people without the code?;_Label_Zero
Keep up the good work!;_Label_Perf
I post some photos last night and when i browse it now i cant see it.;_Label_Zero
The home,discovery and activity tabs are not to be seen after update on app.what's wrong??;_Label_Zero
For some reason my keyboard glitches every time I use it in this app.;_Label_Perf
I end up having to restart my phone just so the keyboard will minimize.;_Label_Zero
The app is fine as long as I don't want to tweet anything.;_Label_Zero
Love the semi material design.;_Label_Zero
Wish we could see more of that!;_Label_Zero
Twitter is so amazing;_Label_Zero
It never freezes on me and keeps updated constantly ??;_Label_Perf
Its verry cool and mind blowing;_Label_Zero
Doesn't let me change my header or bio.;_Label_Zero
Just says 'updating profile' in my notification bar forever & doesn't go away.;_Label_Zero
Until I restart my phone.;_Label_Perf
The new layout doesn't look nice!!!;_Label_Zero
Please switch it back, it looked so much nicer.;_Label_Zero
There is this annoying bug where I can't reach some half of my tweets on my profile page.;_Label_Zero
If someone has favorited it, though, it is completely accessible through notifications panel.;_Label_Zero
THE FONT IS SO BIG PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD FONT.;_Label_Zero
THE SMALL FONT;_Label_Zero
The app seems to get slower with every update.;_Label_Zero
Search takes an eternity, and just refreshing the time line takes longer than before.;_Label_Perf
It's also frustrating that you can't see all of someone's tweets when you go to their profile - there are big time gaps between the tweets that do load.;_Label_Zero
For all the updates, it's not getting better, just slowing down and offering less functionality...;_Label_Zero
Is great but the app is slow now and takes forever to load videos or see others post by the hashtag.;_Label_Perf
Also the area to start a tweet is small so sometimes I accidentally press on the tweet in front of it and it is annoying.;_Label_Zero
Twitter needs some better adjustments.;_Label_Zero
Why Microphone acces ?;_Label_Zero
Thanks for the update;_Label_Zero
I think the Twitter app is brill I can interact with the subjects that are of interest to me and like minded people.;_Label_Zero
I can't see any recent tweets when I go to people's profiles.;_Label_Zero
Locked me out for no reason and I can't get back on.;_Label_Zero
Can't get enough.;_Label_Zero
Most things work well and I have no problem with it but I don't understand how there isn't a quick way to go to my feed.;_Label_Zero
Sometimes I have to hit back a dozen times if I went on a little twitter journey.;_Label_Zero
"Also, how many times do I have to say no to if I ""liked that highlight"" before it stops showing them to me?";_Label_Zero
It's turning into Facebook with that crap and I don't use that anymore.;_Label_Zero
I just want to see tweets in order of time on my feed.;_Label_Zero
It's nice to share and update.;_Label_Zero
It's a great app and all but it keeps crashing again and again... I have to uninstall and install it once again.;_Label_Zero
Why favourite button does not exist on my twitter.pleasee;_Label_Zero
The flow is great and your Twitter is never boring due to the activity section;_Label_Zero
Third party photo service.;_Label_Zero
Shortener for URL.;_Label_Zero

I haven't been able to access my twitter through the app for the past 5 hours.;_Label_Zero
Had a bug, the update fixed it.;_Label_Perf
this is like a good app so get it and because its a good way to keep in touch with people;_Label_Zero
Keep discover and activity !;_Label_Zero
Bad new update and photo show and it became silly when making retweets;_Label_Zero
The lists tab no longer displays any lists.;_Label_Zero
Anything can be improved but I have no complaints.;_Label_Zero
This app is still not working, with no tweets showing in my timeline.;_Label_Zero
Sometimes pictures will not load regardless if im on 4G or Wifi.;_Label_Zero
Where's the top bar gone?!;_Label_Zero
Was good app had no problems until top bar went missing;_Label_Zero
Hard to know what the symbols mean;_Label_Zero
Stalk the famous and avoid real life.;_Label_Zero
It won't tell me when I receive a DM;_Label_Zero
Does what it says;_Label_Perf
The only thing I hate is how I accept the followers' requests and I go out to check the feed but when look at the followers's requests again, the same followers' request are still there!;_Label_Zero
They NEVER go away, it always shows that I have a certain amount of follower requests which I had accepted before.;_Label_Zero
Don't know why people moan so much.;_Label_Zero
Y'all needa fix this app y'all bugging man.;_Label_Zero
Recommends people I don't want to see;_Label_Zero

I'm not getting no information you'll need to fix this;_Label_Zero
I like this app...but why it often updating the same issue?;_Label_Zero
There is a problem with twitter every time I open it.;_Label_Perf
It hangs my phone so please focus on this issue.;_Label_Zero
