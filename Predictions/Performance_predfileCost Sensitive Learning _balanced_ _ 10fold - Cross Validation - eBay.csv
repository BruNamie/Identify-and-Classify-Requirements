Haven't been able to use it yet.;_Label_Zero
I have tried but it keeps asking for my user name and password and won't let me go any further.;_Label_Zero
Gets the simple jobs done, able to select and pay on the spot pretty happy with this app what else can i say?;_Label_Zero
I have the same problem on two different phones, even after several updates to the app.No matter what I do with the notifications, they never stop.;_Label_Perf
I have each individual notification type turned off, and I have the general notification toggle turned off.;_Label_Zero
It even displays a brief popup when I do this which says it is updating the settings.;_Label_Perf
And yet, the crummy bloop still keeps coming.The has been a problem since last year with a Nexus S, and now the same happens with the new Moto G (not that the phone model should have anything to do with the app's own settings).;_Label_Perf
I downloaded the ebay app because I had some specific items I wanted to look for and I wasn't at home near my desktop.;_Label_Zero
I would recommend it and find myself using the app more often than going into the office to check things out on the desktop.;_Label_Zero
For viewing and bidding the droid app is the way to go.;_Label_Zero
If I am closing in on a bid I keep laptop and tablet going but the tablet is my preference.;_Label_Zero
The slimmed down UI makes it very easy to bid, buy and get notified!;_Label_Zero
Got to love Ebay and now I have access to it on my phone and Kindle.;_Label_Zero

Very simple navagation and browsing tools!;_Label_Zero
I like that a list of your activity on ebay is easy to see and manage and it doesn't move from your main search list.;_Label_Zero
Great for watching those bids and just finding special items.;_Label_Zero
I have been dealing with ebay for years, almost all of my transactions were great.;_Label_Zero
And the best part about it is you don't have to deal with the over populated communities that we all live in.;_Label_Zero
Ebay is easy to use and a great way to get products at good prices without driving miles and wasting hours shopping and not finding the product I am looking for.;_Label_Zero
You can do some basic things with it... probably should have rated it a 4, but my God do I hate ebay...;_Label_Zero
I had my items to sell listed in minutes and there was even the option of importing pictures from my phone, no need to download to my computer!;_Label_Zero
Loaded this on my HTC 8X windows phone and it does everything I expect of it.;_Label_Perf
Easy to use and handy.;_Label_Zero
Log in easy, search easy.;_Label_Zero

I enter the search criteria and it sends me an update if someone posts it.;_Label_Perf
I love to shop on ebay.;_Label_Zero
Makes shopping much more easier.;_Label_Zero
I find this app easy to manage my ebay listing at a glance.;_Label_Zero
I know you can do more with it but I still use the computer to list my items.;_Label_Zero

Online if your not a member you can just pay for ur itemAnd then who ever ships to u like your a member the app doesn't give you a choice it makes u sign inSo I was going to purchase something off my kindle but instead had to go find it on eBay on the computer because I wasn't a member;_Label_Zero
It is very user friendly.;_Label_Zero

I have no problem purchasing items from this app.;_Label_Perf

which is not surpising, because they are virtually the same thing.;_Label_Zero

Runs smoothly on my Kindle and syncs with my account, therefore all my devices are updated and match.The mobile version is easy to use, I haven't posted a sale with my Kindle, but I am able to monitor anything I have posted from my phone or computer, and I can easily search and bid on items without any problems.;_Label_Zero

But I wish it had a link to the full site like the mobile version does.;_Label_Zero
I find myself having to leave the app to go to website for some things... Like customer service for example.;_Label_Zero
Understated version of the the websight.;_Label_Zero
Works well for a scaled down version.;_Label_Perf
I recommend this to anyone wanting to use ebay on their Kindle.;_Label_Zero
I really wanted to like it but find it is to dissimilar to the computer format I am used to.;_Label_Zero
Hard to find what I am looking for with the little drop downs.;_Label_Zero
I wouldn't use it to list an item, but I would probably use it to buy and check listings.;_Label_Zero
This app is easy to navigate and a joy to use!!;_Label_Zero
It is so much better than opening a browser window and doing that way.;_Label_Zero

Makes me not want to do any ratings;_Label_Zero
this is great to have...still learning how to  use.;_Label_Zero

If you want to buy things, you don't get as many results for your searches as you would on a pc.;_Label_Zero
So I wish they would fix the problem.;_Label_Perf
It's annoying when I want to find certain things switching between my kindle and the pc.;_Label_Zero
Love having Ebay so handy at all times.So easy to keep up with my bidding.;_Label_Zero
If you want to check up on an item, at any time, this is the one for you!;_Label_Zero
I downloaded this app but never opened it, forgot about it, went on eBay as I usually do.;_Label_Zero
Then I ran into a problem when I tried to buy something, my payment got hung up, could not make my purchase.;_Label_Zero
For days I spent time and money calling eBay, Paypal, the bank, all as usual pointed fingers at the other.;_Label_Zero
Once it was downloaded from the store (never opened) it altered something and this is all I can use when dealing with eBay.;_Label_Zero
I like it, it did take some adjusting to go to this app instead of the internet, but it is a good app...so far.;_Label_Zero
The app is a lot friendlier than the site, and easy to navigate and keep track of my bids.;_Label_Zero
It is properly laid out which allows me to find and track items I have purchased.;_Label_Zero
There is also those alerts that are sent on items ordered but not paid for.;_Label_Zero
I particularly liked that feature because I had some issues earlier with items I had ordered and had difficulty completing the transaction using another app.;_Label_Zero
What can you say.;_Label_Zero
I needed the app and use it to compare prices with Amazon.;_Label_Zero
Only buy if it's free shipping other than that prices are kind of high at ebay.;_Label_Zero
Not sure, but I always check EBay for whatever!;_Label_Zero
E-bay has a great selection of any item you might want.;_Label_Zero
Hopefully, as I use it, my impression will change.;_Label_Zero

It has an easy interface that allows browsing items and My eBay which allows users to login access to your personal profile and items.;_Label_Zero
I'm still getting used to this app.;_Label_Zero
I think I prefer to use a desktop/laptop instead.;_Label_Zero
I just think it's easier to search than this app.;_Label_Zero
Especially if we are travelling I can check auctions of my husband's and that way he doesn't have to find a computer at the hotel immediately.;_Label_Zero
One wish is that the daily deals could be filtered rather one big list that you have to scroll all the way through to see if something interests you.;_Label_Zero
Great app to keep track of all purchases and watched items and it connects to PayPal, which makes it even more convenient.;_Label_Zero
It definitely helps keep track of all purchases made.;_Label_Zero

Very good selection arrangement.;_Label_Zero
I'll revise this review after I have used the product more.;_Label_Zero
It concerns me that items I list can't be found on the search on this app.;_Label_Zero
Plus,  glitchy as far as shipping prices being reflected correctly.;_Label_Zero

Will probably go back and forth, but the app is great for checking, searching, etc.;_Label_Zero
Title says it all.;_Label_Perf
"Text is extremely small on 10&#34; tablet, almost unreadable.";_Label_Zero
I especially love the way it handles my searches where it remembers what I have previously viewed on each search list.;_Label_Zero
Great way to navigate eBay on my Kindle Fire HD.;_Label_Zero
Able to enlarge item photos and further zoom to see every detail.;_Label_Zero
The best and easiest way to peruse Ebay simple to use and well put together.;_Label_Zero
I like it better than the webpage.;_Label_Zero
"This application used to work - now with last 3 &#34;updates&#34; it will not connect to the network.";_Label_Perf
I even contacted eBay.;_Label_Zero
The answer... Yes, it is a known issue and we are working on it, but it could take up to 90 days to fix... Maybe.;_Label_Zero
I can see what deals I can find while I am on lunch and break...;_Label_Zero
I sell prints on eBay as well as other objects and it is very nice to get immediate notifications when something sells or when a buyer/potential buyer has a question!;_Label_Zero
Their mobile site seems to be missing some options for sorting that this app has.;_Label_Zero
So easy to take care of business!;_Label_Zero
I like being on the run and still have access to my business.;_Label_Zero
I like that it notifies you if you have won an item and/or have been outbid on an item.;_Label_Zero
Very well organized and easy to use.;_Label_Zero
All the options you would want in is self-explanatory.;_Label_Zero
