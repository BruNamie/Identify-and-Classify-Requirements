I've used Evernote for quite awhile to take notes on my Android tablet and be able to share and edit them on any PC with a web browser.;_Label_Zero
Not as nice as Microsoft OneNote, but at least it's cross platform.;_Label_Zero
Nice to see that it runs on the Kindle Fire HD.;_Label_Zero
Love that I can sync to my other devices.;_Label_Zero
It has been a big help in keeping me organized with my lists.;_Label_Zero
Have everynote you take on your tablet, phone, or laptop synced without touching a buttom.;_Label_Zero
Highly recommend Evernote if you take notes for anything.;_Label_Zero
I cancelled this app about 10 minutes later, not sure if I didn't give it enough time to understand it or not.;_Label_Zero
Did not like at all, I use the cozi family app and it seems to work much better for what I need;_Label_Zero
I use it for school notes and not only can I use on my kindle fire,  I have the app on my cell phone and my laptop,  so I can never lose my information.;_Label_Zero
please fix the terrible spell check for Pc and list the upgrade price in the app and I would pay for premium.;_Label_Usab
OK, I love Evernote, but sadly can't download it even though it is free because the app store is not available overseas.;_Label_Zero
Seems silly for a free app, doesn't it.;_Label_Zero
On other devices such as iphone, and on the google app store, it's no problem, but Amazon has put to many restrictions on Kindle Fire, so I'm stuck not being able to download any free apps.;_Label_Zero
I should have bought a different product.;_Label_Zero
Never lose your notes again, and access them wherever you are, this app is perfect for any mobile note taker.;_Label_Zero
It performs its basic functions well and works between my pc, phone,  and kindle,  but the organization feels off and their are still occaisonal syncing problems.;_Label_Zero
It's the only tool that works across my devices.;_Label_Zero
It synchronizing capability is transparent and remarkable.;_Label_Zero
word word word word;_Label_Zero
still working out kindle potential but love it thus far.....;_Label_Zero
could be really awesome if I could attached camera pica but don't have that in kindle.;_Label_Zero
Evernote  goes where I go.;_Label_Zero
I use it for everything--recipes, receipts, notes.of all kinds.;_Label_Zero
I have copies on my desktop, my iphone and now my kindle fire.;_Label_Zero
Thanks to the developers.;_Label_Zero
I am not sure how to get out of the original screen to have the notes listed in another place from the running tab on the main screen.R Elliott;_Label_Usab
I started using Evermore on my PC for school.;_Label_Zero
I use it for notes, making copies, storing research.;_Label_Zero
It is such a great tool.;_Label_Zero
It syncs easily between my PC and Kindle Fire so I can take my notes anywhere.;_Label_Zero

perfect to keep my Pc synced with my phone and tablet;_Label_Zero
Works great and synchs to all of my devices.;_Label_Zero
Using it for homeschool lesson plans.;_Label_Zero
I was first introduced to this app for my job, and now I use it everywhere I go.I use it on my Kindle, and have found it to be more than helpful at meetings.;_Label_Zero
I have a terrible memory, and with Evernote I have been able to keep track of everything.;_Label_Zero
I love the features and benefits to using it.;_Label_Zero
The fact that you can clip from the internet is great.;_Label_Zero
It helps alot with school work.;_Label_Zero
It also syncs with other devices without using a manual device sync.;_Label_Zero
This app was constantly updating, contacting me and trying to get on my other wireless devices.;_Label_Zero
It was way too complicated for what I neded - just a simple note pad.;_Label_Usab
This app is a God send.;_Label_Zero
I can easily store and organize my thoughts in ways I never imagined.;_Label_Zero
The best feature is being able to email yourself a note and seeing your notes on the web.;_Label_Zero
I try not to waste any natural brainpower on things that evernote can now remember for me.;_Label_Zero
It is great for note taking or outlining a paper.;_Label_Zero
Only complaint is the sharing options are limited.;_Label_Zero
I have evernote on my laptop and I love it!;_Label_Zero
I use it for personal applications, as well as in my professional life as a teacher.;_Label_Zero
Installed everywhere I needed.;_Label_Zero
A slick note store - really helped me get all of the clutter out of my head!;_Label_Zero
Yo can see it all everywhere.;_Label_Zero
very handy to either make quick note while out or lengthy one at home from computerwould recommend to family or friends;_Label_Zero
I love Evernote simply for the reason that you have your notes accessible from anywhere : kindle,  phone, or PC.;_Label_Zero
Also love the check box option for my to do lists!;_Label_Zero
For the price, you can't beat the kindle fire.;_Label_Usab
I knew that I wouldn't get a calendar or Android Market, so I'm giving it 5 stars because it absolutely meets my expectation.;_Label_Zero
You can keep picture notes and everything you need to keep in this little app right here.;_Label_Zero
Sure they use your contacts but that's all they use.;_Label_Usab
They don't locate you or anything.;_Label_Zero
They use what they have to to create your account.;_Label_Usab
So all you haters need to delete the app if you don't like it.;_Label_Zero
I would recommend this to everyone!!!!!!;_Label_Zero
Good enough synching which is why I needed it in the first place.;_Label_Zero
Could be more dynamic but it's okay so far.;_Label_Zero
Great for taking down note,  I also use it to write down recipes......;_Label_Zero
I would advice everyone to get the app.;_Label_Zero
its the sticky note you have been waiting for;_Label_Zero
this does everything i was looking for i am a sticky note queen and i can organize all my notes and to do's in one place;_Label_Zero
With Evernote, no matter where I am, or what device I use, I can quickly jot down notes, ideas, or important info and not worry about where I saved it.;_Label_Zero
With add-ons like Skitch, I can take pictures of things that inspire my art and make notations right in the image, then Evernote once again makes sure all my devices have a copy.;_Label_Zero
"Very intuitive &amp; user-friendly.";_Label_Usab
Love that it syncs across all platforms - my laptop, Kindle Fire, Android phone, and even accessible on the web from any computer.;_Label_Zero
when i first got my tablet, i was not sure what i was going to do about notetaking in class without Word.;_Label_Zero
this app allows for sharing and can be typed on your laptop as well!;_Label_Zero
love the functionality of this app.;_Label_Zero
works well within my kindle fire, and allows me to take great notes during class.;_Label_Zero
a wonderful application for note taking and the layout even better;_Label_Zero
Easy, Free, Works great.;_Label_Usab
I use it for many things and I keep thinking of more.;_Label_Zero
It's so much easier than having post it notes everywhere.;_Label_Usab
I recommend this for note takers takers everywhere!!;_Label_Zero
As a longtime Evernote User, I was very happy to see the very capable Aneroid app works great on my Kindle tablet.;_Label_Zero
I can't imagine being without it now.;_Label_Zero
I even take my Bible Study notes in it!;_Label_Zero
Awesome software - available on kindle, phone and computer and notes are there for you to access and review or edit!;_Label_Zero
I take message notes at church with Evernote and it is quite useful.;_Label_Zero
The features appeal to every personality and it is easy to use.;_Label_Usab
No more need to carry a notepad around with you - this ap replaces the pen and paper.;_Label_Zero
And what makes it better is that you can have the same note synced on all of your devices - so you can write your shopping list on your computer, and look it up on your iPhone or tablet.;_Label_Zero
This app is a life saver!;_Label_Zero
When your need to jot something down real quick or just take a picture of something to remember.;_Label_Zero
And with school and the voice dictation on my phone is a life saver with long papers to type.;_Label_Zero
I can dictate 500 words in no time, and transfer it to a word document!;_Label_Zero
this app will make you poop your pants!;_Label_Zero
lol I can't figure out why, but it makes me poop myself every time I open it!;_Label_Zero
I love pooping though which is why I gave it 5 stars!;_Label_Zero
Except the program crashed when it asked me to write a review about it.;_Label_Zero
I like how it syncs to my computer and is easy to use.;_Label_Usab
This is a great app for thosd needing to create / access information on multiple computers but don't want to have to carry a thumb drive around.;_Label_Zero
It has an ample amount of free storage and is very User friendly.;_Label_Usab
I have found it to be very reliable with only minor drawbacks, none worth mentioning.;_Label_Zero
I agree with concerns about permissions .;_Label_Zero
Syncs all three without problems.;_Label_Zero
So nice not to wonder where you saved your data and be able to access it and update it from multiple devices.;_Label_Zero
I started working with Evernote last year when looking for a note taking program to organize my class notes.;_Label_Zero
I needed something that could at least reasonably organize scanned note from classes like Calculus and Gen Chem, where notes cant be taken on the computer reasonably.;_Label_Zero
In other courses I found evernote to be perfect, but the shear number of notes often ran me into a wall with the limited 60MB.;_Label_Zero
Since then I have upgraded to the premium edition of Evernote and the service has consistantly gotten better every month.;_Label_Usab
The 60MB pay wall was well engineered.;_Label_Usab
It should be noted that most users dont need to worry about running out their quota.;_Label_Zero
In fact it is nearly impossible to run out your quota if you are only taking text notes and saving web clippings.;_Label_Zero
You may consider upgrading if archiving large quantities of PDFs and Pictures is your goal.On the Kindle Fire this apps start screen is a little redundant.;_Label_Zero
The New Note button and Attach button are the only two that work.;_Label_Zero
The add voice note and photo note do the same thing as the attach button.;_Label_Zero
The interface has been well redesigned to make working with it more intuitive albeit a little bit chunkier.As a premium user I take advantage of the extra space in very creative ways.;_Label_Usab
I am a student, and just like any other student I sit through countless powerpoint lectures.;_Label_Zero
I like to use the the table tool (in the desktop client) to put all the slides in one column and the descriptions in the other.;_Label_Zero
When reading on the Android app you can then quicky and effectively go through andAs for PDFs, there is no integrated reader that allows you to display the files inline like the desktop clients.;_Label_Zero
Instead the PDFs are shown as attachments.;_Label_Zero
When clicked they are opened in what ever pdf reader you have - or on the Kindle Fire the PDF is opened in the kindle reader software which is only well designed for reading appropriately formated pdfs.;_Label_Zero
I would recommend installing Adobe ReaderAdobe Readerwhich perfectly displays PDFs on the kindle fire.For whatever reason, on the Kindle Fire voice notes will not play.;_Label_Zero
I understand that the 1st gen Kindle Fire doesn't have a microphone so no you can't make audio notes.Update: Thursday Nov 8th 2012[...]Evernote announced serious changes to their client and their service addressing many of the concerns of reviewers.;_Label_Zero
I love this app including the PC version and I especially love the easy sync.;_Label_Usab
It has more functionality than I expected!;_Label_Zero
Vastly superior to the other note apps I've used.;_Label_Zero
Keeps me organized.;_Label_Zero
Great way to sync notes across platforms.;_Label_Zero
I use it in tandem with Pulse to save recipes.;_Label_Zero
And it's free: what's not to love?;_Label_Zero
I have it on my Kindle Fire an use it for making lists.;_Label_Zero
The checkbox option comes in very handy.;_Label_Zero
I use Evernote as my primary note-taking method in college, and to be honest, it's been one of the most helpful applications I've ever used!;_Label_Zero
My only two minor gripes are that there is a persistant bug that prevents me from editing many of my notes on an iPhone (the screen jumps around with every keypress), and the overly-minimalistic formatting options, necessitating a separate word processor for essays or any other serious papers.;_Label_Zero
Fix those, and I'll pay for the app with no regrets!;_Label_Zero
This is a brilliant program.;_Label_Zero
It syncs with my PC, my Notebook, my Netbook, my Kindle and my android phone seamlessly.;_Label_Zero
"It holds everything from web pages to simple notes to complex itineraries.Evernote is my &#34;go-to&#34; program for retaining information.";_Label_Usab
I write songs and like to keep a diary so Evernote really helps me keep track of everything.;_Label_Zero
I also like Skitch, which lets you draw pics and sign your name on important notes.;_Label_Zero
It is a separate download but once its downloaded you can click the link let you sign or draw onto your notes.;_Label_Zero
I just use this for everything: grocery lists, recipes, websites, schedules, story writing, class notes, ect.;_Label_Zero
This is on my computer, Kindle Fire and Iphone and can be synced across all these devices.;_Label_Zero
I have to say, when it came to using planners, I'd always say I prefer paper to electronic.;_Label_Zero
Not so much anymore, although this isn't a planner, exactly.;_Label_Zero
But, you can certainly make it one if you wanted.;_Label_Zero
I love how you can format it with check boxes and tables.;_Label_Zero
It really has helped me keep organized with everything in one place and easy to find.;_Label_Usab
No more wondering where I wrote that note down, what that website was, or where my grocery list ran off to.;_Label_Zero
I love how this app syncs with all my devices, inc my phone and tablet.;_Label_Zero
It has helped me organize my work and personal life so much that I would be lost without it.;_Label_Zero
I have a droid phone and am used to the Andronotes app so I haven't really used this one yet.;_Label_Zero
I think I'm just used to the andronotes, but I will definitely take time to get adjusted to it.;_Label_Zero
One thing that would make it better than andronotes is if it is alphabetical when searching for notes!;_Label_Zero
very useful app, you can note sonething in your mobile device then view it on your computer.;_Label_Zero
or the oppsite :)pls,it has an add-in in outlook too.;_Label_Zero
Works in different applications syncs between all my devices.;_Label_Zero
Set up very easy and started using right away.;_Label_Usab
Thank u for providing this.;_Label_Zero
Only thing I ask is create a way to drag notes from books on kindle fire;_Label_Zero
I am a busy lady.;_Label_Zero
Wife, mother, full time employee in public education, student, as well as the founder of two non profit organizations.;_Label_Zero
I can make a file for everything from my son's funny quotes, to homework and tasks, as well as make separate note files for both of my non profits.;_Label_Zero
The only down side is that not all the options available on your computer and tablet are available on the phone application.;_Label_Zero
App has been invaluable to me in keeping track of certain articles as well as being able to send them to my different email sites.;_Label_Zero
great for multiple device users.;_Label_Zero
i have several and can share with the wife instantly.;_Label_Zero
i had go set it up for her but thats not the point;_Label_Zero
So far,this app is helping me be organized.;_Label_Zero
"I use this for my business and it makes delegating and tracking my &quot;to do&quot; list so much more convenient.";_Label_Zero
I love how you can create separate notebooks and include attachments for any use.;_Label_Zero
They need to fix the butt ugly iphone version.;_Label_Zero
Hoping they don't roll out the ugly as he'll iphone version for kindle.;_Label_Zero
I have used evermore for over six months and so far it has met my needs adequately.;_Label_Zero
I am still concerned about the privacy issues.;_Label_Zero
I wish I knew how to rotate a picture but I'm learning more and more each day for an old geezer.;_Label_Zero
I'd like a complete substitute for OneNote, and this isn't it, but it does a lot.;_Label_Zero
I like synchronizing across platforms, especially.;_Label_Zero
"I even love the Internet browser &quot;clipper&quot;.";_Label_Zero
I never forget anything anymore!!;_Label_Zero
Evernote is one of the note apps that's been around for a while and is very popular.;_Label_Zero
As a result, it's been well tested, debugged, and refined over the years and you can expect a smooth, bug-free, and capable app when you buy it.;_Label_Zero
Evernote has exceptional file and information handling capabilities and allows you to capture, store and share not just notes but photos, webpages, freehand drawings and graphics, and pretty much anything you want.;_Label_Zero
The premium edition allows your friends to access and modify your notes and so offers group collaboration capabilities.Another area Evernote excels in is the sheer number and diversity of its companion apps.;_Label_Zero
Just a quick look at what was available at the Apple store revealed no less than 20 and there were more that I didn't bother to scroll through when I stopped.;_Label_Zero
There are more and there is often more than one app available in a particular category (note management, daily journal, etc.) so that if you don't like that particular companion app there may be another you will like.In reading the reviews here I note that some people didn't like Evernote wanting access to all of their contacts, which they considered an invasion of privacy.;_Label_Zero
So if this is a probem for you you should consider that before buying the app.Overall Evernote offers a lot of value for the money and has the most add-ons and companion apps of any app in the note category.;_Label_Zero
There is something for just about everyone so if you're looking for a good note and task app Evernote is one of the top offerings that you should consider.;_Label_Zero
I have Evernote apps on my Kindle Fire, iphone, ans browser at work and I'm able to email myself notes, links, etc and then open in any said mediums and since.;_Label_Zero
Useful in too many ways to list.;_Label_Zero
Anything you need to save online and/or add notes to comes together perfectly in this app.;_Label_Zero
The easy to use UI and cross platform syncing and integration is what puts this app above the rest.;_Label_Usab
I use it on my phone, my laptop and iTouch and my tablet and it syncs instantly and seamlessly.;_Label_Zero
Evernote is wonderful app.Really helps keep me on point.;_Label_Zero
I love the fact that it synchs across all my devices automatically.;_Label_Zero
I was looking for and quick and easy way to write on my kindle and have access to it everywhere.;_Label_Usab
This app is a dream come true for list makers!;_Label_Zero
Evernote works so well with all of my devices.;_Label_Zero
I love having one place to go and see all my notes.;_Label_Zero
i have used it to take notes in classes and it works brilliantly.;_Label_Zero
i can access my notes from my other computers, organize them in notebooks and tags and add web content and other attachments that make this app an excellent addition to any computer, tablet, or phone.;_Label_Zero
if you ever need to make checklists, remember names or emails, or take notes this is the app for you.;_Label_Zero
Like the ability to format notes in various ways and the sync to web works great as well.;_Label_Zero
The amount of storage in the free version is more than enough for my needs.;_Label_Zero
Evernote has been a go-to app at home and on my phone for a little over a year.;_Label_Zero
Its a bit processor heavy but the updates are tweaking it into place (hopefully).;_Label_Zero
The Android App has been improving over the releases and as a paid subscriber I've invested a lot of time into making a usable and searchable database for multiple projects from digital to analog projects;_Label_Zero
fast, easy, and able to reach your notes anywhere.;_Label_Usab
No fancy stuff just what a writer needs.;_Label_Zero
I have been using it for about a month now and I put everything in it!;_Label_Usab
I even use the email and it works great.;_Label_Zero
Great piece of software.;_Label_Zero
This app is great, compatible with so many programs, great sharing options and the sync has never failed me between my PC, GS3, Kindle Fire and Notebook!;_Label_Zero
I Highly recommend this app for anyone who needs to list, note, share or do just about anything else it offers!;_Label_Zero
I clip selected text, web pages and links and can access them later on any of my devices.;_Label_Zero
I also create short notes and to-do lists with Evernote.;_Label_Zero
I've only used the free version so far but I love it and recommend it highly.;_Label_Zero
Big fan of Evernote.;_Label_Zero
It's my business goto, safe for ideas, and collector of things that intrigue me on the internet.;_Label_Zero
Check it out.;_Label_Zero
I found the app to be too invasive in that it wants you to load it up will all sorts of personal information on all of your devices that it will then share with, seemingly, anyone who wants it.;_Label_Zero
I can put info, tasks and files on my e-mail that I can share with all of my devices without Evernote snooping into them.;_Label_Zero
I always liked evernote I can do my homework where ever and print it out from the website I save notes from school and able to save them I specific folders for later review and print I highly recommend this app for students especially students on the Go!;_Label_Zero
I use this app pretty much everyday for storing interesting quotes, or jotting down ideas.;_Label_Zero
It has allowed me to get rid of my notebooks and sticky notes, and consolidate them into something that virtually consumes no room/work space.;_Label_Zero
this is a terrific tool for organizing your thoughts.;_Label_Zero

works well with awesome notes...;_Label_Zero
"Free or not, I expect it to ""get here.""";_Label_Zero
It's the only download problem I've had so far.;_Label_Zero
not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said in the 2131 reviews already posted.;_Label_Zero
love the ease of the app and cross platform.;_Label_Zero
I like that this can act as my idea pad for songs and screenplays.;_Label_Zero
The best thing is that I can access it on any device with the same e-mail!;_Label_Zero
this app has completely changed and reorganized my life... from business cards that I get, to ideas I have and want to be able to access from anywhere, to pretty much WHATEVER... this app has been amazing.;_Label_Zero
I will be purchasing the full version soon.;_Label_Zero
this is the only app i have ever taken the time to review... it rocks.;_Label_Zero
Had a problem with it syncing.;_Label_Zero
with my laptop but a simple reinstall fixed that.;_Label_Usab
I don't know where I'd be without Evernote!;_Label_Zero
I cannot sign in with the password I use on the desktop, cannot reset the password because it not recognize the email address, and cannot register because the same email it does not recognize is allready in use.;_Label_Zero
For use on multiple devices this app is a sink hole for wasting time and effort trying to set it up.;_Label_Zero
I love that I can access the information from my phone, computer, and Kindle.;_Label_Zero
Honestly haven't used it yet, but with so many reviews entered why should you care?;_Label_Zero
Make a note of that.;_Label_Zero

the only thing I hate is that the government has access to all my movie ideas which I have seen come to film threw out the years.;_Label_Zero
but that's the price I have to pay for not getting my lazy beer drinking fat asss off my couch and making them myself. . . sigh.;_Label_Usab
I've used this app to plan an entire choir tour to Germany and Austria this past May, and am currently working on digitizing a suggested menu for a fine dining restaurant.;_Label_Zero
Works amazingly, along with Skitch, but I wish there was a way to import notes into a type of presentation app.;_Label_Zero
I use it for my grocery and to-do lists and I love it!;_Label_Zero
love the program, best thing that I can use to keep track of all my notes I scatter around.;_Label_Zero

good job guys!!;_Label_Zero
i had to switch Kindles after one was faulty and Evernote was an easy way to keep all my documents.;_Label_Usab
the only thing is that it doesnt save larger files.;_Label_Zero
I use this when I don't have access to my computer to type up my homework.;_Label_Zero
and because I have the app on my phone I can work on my homework anywhere.;_Label_Zero
great app that does what it says.;_Label_Zero
only gripe is the interface on the kindle could be better.;_Label_Zero
