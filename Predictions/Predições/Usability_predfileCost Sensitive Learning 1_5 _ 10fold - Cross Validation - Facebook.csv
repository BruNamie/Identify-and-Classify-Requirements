I am loving my Kindle Fire Hd and accessories we got for it!It's great for my email and reading books.;_Label_Zero
I decorated my black cover with some pretty stickers of crystals!;_Label_Zero
Like being able to keep up with facebook when I travel.;_Label_Zero
It's not exactly the same as playing on your home computer but you are able to stay in touch.;_Label_Zero
I don't have to get on my computer to see FB, helps me to keep up with what's going on , love it.;_Label_Zero
Won't load people's pages, freezes when I try to watch a video, I have to force close the app when I look at pictures, and news feed doesn't lead.;_Label_Zero
When using the new updated Kindle version, heaven help you.;_Label_Zero
At some point, you will type something that contains a friend or liked interest and you will not be able to type what you intended to.;_Label_Zero
I guess when I actually need to post something, I will need to go pick up my iPhone.;_Label_Zero
This app worked ok beyond some glitches but forced me to update even though I tried before and it didn't work and more it won't even open.;_Label_Zero
I love it jus like a pc very easy to log in and out enjoy friends and meet new ones along with family and classmates.would reccomend to everyone;_Label_Zero
I can check in from anywhere my Kindle takes me.;_Label_Zero
no better way to stay caught up with your friends on FB, easy to use, a good app.;_Label_Usab
could use some tweaks but overall solid.;_Label_Zero
I have used this app for most of the year, but as of yesterday I have not been able to get past login blue screen.;_Label_Zero
Either this is virus attacking itself only to this app or it is a very bad update.;_Label_Zero
Other Facebook applications are hard to work with, one can not find the commands, the page freezes, or one can get lost and find it difficult to return to original screan - This App -WORKS!;_Label_Zero
Facebook helps you keep in touch with friends that otherwise would be literally impossible to stay in touch with.;_Label_Zero
Cruising along on FB when all of a sudden, I cannot open it anymore.;_Label_Zero
Opens on silk just fine.;_Label_Zero
the app is responsive but one problem.when sending a message to someone the plus nd smokey face Icon for sending images is their but when I press it no options for pics or stickers to send comes up.not a major problem to me although to some people probably yes.fixxxxx asap;_Label_Zero
I never thought that I 'd be on face book, my grand kids put me out there and now I enjoy reading what they're doing.;_Label_Zero
pictures are great since picture taking and developing is getting to be a thing of the past, cell phones hold their pictures.;_Label_Zero
It logs you on and is usually stable.;_Label_Zero
The pictures that appear on my timeline take up the entire screen and are not automatically sized down.;_Label_Zero
I did have it freeze on me a couple of times and I thought it was going to crash, but it managed to recover.;_Label_Zero
If they can make it so your photos don't take up the entire screen and fix the freezing issues, it would be a little more useful.;_Label_Zero
That is my biggest gripe, along with not being able to show my jewelry on my timeline...have to use a business page which most people don't go to often!;_Label_Zero
I wish I could rate this with negative stars, because it's just that terrible.;_Label_Zero
July 9 ,2014 update has made this app unusable.;_Label_Zero
I can not open it.;_Label_Zero
I have deleted the a pop and reinstalled it several times.;_Label_Zero
Thanks update, job well done.........Not!;_Label_Zero
it keeps glitching.;_Label_Zero
I like the social aspect of it but, sometimes the privacy sttings are confusing.;_Label_Zero
I use it when I don't feel like getting up to check my FB.;_Label_Zero
Plus you get messages instantly.;_Label_Zero
After the first 10 or so posts the rest just load as blue text without pictures and it doesn't change after refresh.;_Label_Zero
the only posts that show up on the kindle fire app are whatever they decide to show.;_Label_Zero
there is no way of searching new posts or most recent.;_Label_Zero
How do I use the new update I can't even find my own profile or any settings anymore?;_Label_Zero
In my opinion I think this is someplace for people to gossip.;_Label_Zero
The Facebook app can be very helpful keeping up with your facebook.;_Label_Zero
But it also malfunctions a lot sometimes.;_Label_Zero
But other than that the app is dependable and could probably use an update.;_Label_Zero
This is a great app...it is big and beautiful with large pictures and all the features from the desktop version!;_Label_Zero
its great except i miss things because the news feed wont load prior events, and i cant check facebook all day;_Label_Zero
you keep connected to the outside world learn a lot about people get to to see family and friends pictures help out something to bebefit others good recipes ect.;_Label_Zero
i hate the fact that on the kindle you cant send voice messages, when it has a speaker!;_Label_Zero
I am new and often feel unclear on using different areas and getting simple instructions seems far too complicated.;_Label_Usab
Where does one find FaceBook for Dummies?;_Label_Zero
i picked 5 stars because facebook is the best.i have found many friends and relatives i havent seen in years.how can you beat that.i am hook on facebook.should have been on  it sooner.;_Label_Zero
App won't install completely.;_Label_Zero
"Keeps showing &amp;#34;install failed&amp;#34;.";_Label_Zero
Requires additional steps now for me to access Facebook.;_Label_Zero
There are more options available to you if you use a PC or Mac instead.;_Label_Zero
"However, this app still retains a lot of the features that I use most often; for example, event info, news feed stories, photo album viewing, videos, etc.";_Label_Zero
I like the layout of the application, but I like my applkication posts hidden once I have viewed them.;_Label_Zero
I give this a 3 rating as you cannot hide posts in your newsfeed.;_Label_Zero
Defintely worth downloading.;_Label_Zero
Um yea, new layout is ugly, where do I see notifications?;_Label_Zero
How can I get to my own profile, events, friends, everything!;_Label_Zero
How do I get to messages?!;_Label_Zero
Very bad update.;_Label_Zero
The pictures are so big that it is more than annoying, and is an irritant.;_Label_Usab
Can't do highlight, copy, then paste.;_Label_Zero
I can only access the latest 6 news feed entries at any one time.;_Label_Zero
as others have said, it only loads the first few posts in the news feed.;_Label_Zero
think its great.a wonderful way to connect with friends,i like th new look,keep up the good work its the best.;_Label_Zero
I would absolutely positively reccomend to anyone I know!;_Label_Zero
I have only got the app load once.;_Label_Zero
Facebook is how we talk back and forth with our grandkids and friends since they are in another state.;_Label_Zero
Very smooth and excellent for stalking your buddies online.It's free, works better than most devices, what's not to like?;_Label_Zero
Comprehensive one roof many thoughts,Games,Feelings, sharing, the best platform for meeting people.Easy  to associate with other applications  like I use to post my links from Fotopedia.;_Label_Usab
This is really great, I can stay in contact with family and friends.;_Label_Zero
Also put my view points and daily word on Face book.;_Label_Zero
I can also view pictures of family and friends.;_Label_Zero
i have trouble with the posts loading.;_Label_Zero
it shows about 10, then tends to freeze up.;_Label_Zero
When I open the app it keeps reinstalling itself over and over again please fix it today it's going to make the masses hate you if you dont;_Label_Zero
I know that I need to get a life when I check my Facebook daily.;_Label_Zero
It's connected me to people I haven't heard from in years!;_Label_Zero
Even at twenty seven years old, I still check on lives of old friends.;_Label_Zero
cant see more than a few posts then the spinning circle of death at the bottom of the screen.;_Label_Zero
Love watching my family and friends out of state;_Label_Zero
I think messenger is included for quasi private emails.;_Label_Zero
"Cannot adjust news feed for &amp;#34;most recent&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;top stories&amp;#34;.";_Label_Zero
Cannot mark notifications as read.;_Label_Zero
Cannot see entire photo album from news feed.;_Label_Zero
"Missing functionality in messaging &amp; events.";_Label_Zero
Constantly wants to update but updates fail.;_Label_Zero
I really do like Facebook a lotLike I get to see other people some of them be my family some be friends Facebook is very awesome;_Label_Zero
It helps me to stay in touch with family [especially those living out of state] and friends.;_Label_Zero
At first I would see a handful of posts, and then another handful listed underneath in shaded boxes that you can't access.;_Label_Zero
Now I don't have the boxes anymore, but it only lets me scroll down so far and stops.;_Label_Zero
So if you want to access something beyond that, you can't.;_Label_Zero
Save yourself the trouble and just access Facebook through your browser.;_Label_Zero
The newsfeed only shows a few posts, then there are these weird blue blocks that you can't even click.;_Label_Zero
Hopefully it will be fixed with an update soon.;_Label_Zero
The app no longer loads properly since I downloaded the update.;_Label_Zero
Until the problem is fixed I will be without access to Facebook and therefore unable to communicate properly with friends and family.;_Label_Zero
Because I have limited eyesight I prefer facebook on my Mac over my Iphone or Kindle fire.;_Label_Zero
Facebook keeps changing things I like about it and it frustrates me.;_Label_Zero
"I cannot seem to ever get a Facebook session running without seeing &#34;error loading story&#34; message.";_Label_Zero
Seems like they have more work to do to create a compelling FB phone app.;_Label_Zero
Updated version will not open!!;_Label_Zero
easy to download and use everything is there at your fingertips and the pics look awesome in HD just perfect;_Label_Usab
The full news feed and peoples time lines will not load all the way.;_Label_Zero
Though this is the full Facebook app, it tends to lag behind in updates.;_Label_Zero
Helps me keep up with friends and family.;_Label_Zero
Wish people would keep their political views to themselves, though.;_Label_Zero
This should be for fun and information.;_Label_Zero
I have a kindle HD 8.9, and I know the look/feel can be better than it is, given the size of my device.;_Label_Zero
You can also apply to be a Beta tester for tablets if you want too.;_Label_Zero
The graphics are nice and works well on our tablet.;_Label_Zero
Worth the time to get.;_Label_Zero
jumps to the top when you back out of a posting and will not give a friends complete list;_Label_Zero
Happy to be able to get on FB and check things from my new Kindle Fire HD.;_Label_Zero
So if you are willing to settle for mostly good enough, then this is the application for you.;_Label_Zero
I'm happy with facebook on my kindle and I like to follow my grandchildren on facebook and my friends too;_Label_Zero
Now I can look at more post before it only showed a few posts.;_Label_Zero
I love how easy it is to connect with (old) long time friends, and family, I have learned a lot of interesting things.;_Label_Zero
I check it a few times a day.;_Label_Zero
when I sign on and it sits there loading for ever and when I click on the tab on the top it loads my messages just fine.;_Label_Zero
I love to read the gossip that everyone shares.;_Label_Zero
I especially love the pictures of my friends & family that are shared;_Label_Zero
The site does not have enough privacy protection -- I do not want the entire world to know (my personal information or what I share with my friends) -- only my friends ---- plus I do not like the options that protect the sharing and posting functions -- options need to have conditions such as only with my friends or open to all.;_Label_Zero
When something is posted that has a link and you click on it, it takes you to a Web page, but there's no way to get back to Facebook without hitting home and going back to the app.;_Label_Zero
This is the best method I have found to stay in touch with my friends and family.;_Label_Zero
From all around the world we can communicate.;_Label_Zero
I just updated and now my app doesn't work at all!;_Label_Zero
"It just says &quot;Facebook has stopped&quot; every time I open it.";_Label_Zero
not enough words to post my review.well now I can;_Label_Zero
on my kindle fire this is the only way I have to post photos on facebook now since facebooks last stupid change to their uploading.;_Label_Zero
to upload I download the pic I want to post, go to the kindle gallery, select the pic, hit menu, hit share, then choose this facebook program.;_Label_Zero
Easy way to view family and friends, their pictures especially and their interests.;_Label_Usab
Life is so hectic, it is becoming more difficult to stay in touch, especially when living further and further apart.;_Label_Zero
I recommend facebook to those who like to stay connected on a more personal level;_Label_Zero
I like the older versions best.;_Label_Zero
I hate they keep changing the look even of MY page without my consent.;_Label_Zero
Post often don't show when they should.;_Label_Zero
Most recently, they took money from my checking account without my permission.;_Label_Zero
Too often I've had scammers trying to be friends on hijacked accounts.;_Label_Zero
I only have this to try and promote my work.;_Label_Zero
I like having access to Facebook, but I'm so disappointed that I can't play my Facebook games on my Kindle.;_Label_Zero
As a facebook addict, this app is obviously awesome for those who want to stay connected to facebook.;_Label_Zero
I do wish there was a better(any) alert system like on your iPhone for when you get new alerts(comments, likes, messages).;_Label_Zero
But I guess that's alright b/c being that my kindle doesn't ding when I get an alert my iPhone WILL so if I want to use my kindle I still can b/c my iPhone will alert me and then instead of using it to get on FB I just get on my kindle instead.;_Label_Zero
You can't even watch a video for 2 seconds.;_Label_Zero
It always force close.;_Label_Zero
The new update wasn't worth it.;_Label_Zero
Slow to load on smart phone and desktop PC.;_Label_Zero
Search incomplete and complicated.;_Label_Zero
Changing the background takes forever.;_Label_Zero
On my phone it will let you look at status' etc for as long you want to scroll down, but the app wouldn't only let me look and then it wouldn't bring up anything else.;_Label_Zero
I haven't been able to post for awhile now.;_Label_Zero
What's the point of the app if all you can do is read.;_Label_Zero
Stop wasting time collecting and analyzing usage and make an app that works.;_Label_Zero
I like the ease of uploading phptps to my facebook page from my gallery.;_Label_Zero
I do not stay logged in all the time as I do not like to get notifacations all the time;_Label_Zero
Facebook is facebook, I wish they had a dislike button.;_Label_Zero
Why am I even rating this.;_Label_Zero
Its only the number social media sites.;_Label_Zero
Can also download and print posted photos!;_Label_Zero
APP WORKS FINE, JUST NEED TO FIND SOMEONE TO SHOW BE HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF FACEBOOK, NEVER SURE WHERE I AM OR WHERE I'AM GOING.;_Label_Zero
it helps me keep in touch with my kids and grandkids.;_Label_Zero
dont like the ever changing stuff when i get used to it you all change it but im hanging in there;_Label_Zero
It facebook run great let you hook up to existing accounts really well it is  well.;_Label_Zero
I can  say that it was easy to install and use.;_Label_Usab
Let me hook up with family and friends.;_Label_Zero
Been on for quite awhile.Like keeping up with family.;_Label_Zero
Its ok but if u want to block sum one u can't unless there ur friend.;_Label_Zero
But I still like it an I reported sexually explicit an it came back as a negative it dont have sexual explicit.;_Label_Zero
Since this morning I haven't been able to open Facebook.;_Label_Zero
It loads for awhile then shuts off.;_Label_Zero
And I uninstalled it but it keeps reinstalling itself.;_Label_Zero
It allows me to talk ti my friends while in completely different places, almost like the computer version.;_Label_Zero
The Facebook app most recent update forces you to view your timeline in Top Stories format.;_Label_Zero
You no longer have the option to view your timeline in Most Recent order.;_Label_Zero
You are better off pulling up Facebook in the Silk web browser.;_Label_Zero
Or, just dumping Facebook since the obviously don't care what the customers want.;_Label_Zero
There is no way to switch from 'Most recent' to 'Top stories'.;_Label_Zero
The notification center doesn't work.;_Label_Zero
And, I can no longer get to my groups or favorites.;_Label_Zero
