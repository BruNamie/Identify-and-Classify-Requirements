So if you like an artist it'll change your station to better the selection but if you accidentally like someone you don't because you were trying to press the dislike button then you're kinda screwed.;_Label_Zero
They forgot to let you unlike someone so please fix.;_Label_Zero
It's wierd to go from smooth music to country out of no where.;_Label_Zero
Up until this recent update I had a search bar but now it's not there anymore.;_Label_Zero
I have seen other people with same problem so hopeful they fix it soon.;_Label_Zero
Other than that premium is too expensive but still good app.;_Label_Zero
Everytime I try to use the app it doesn't respond and I keep reporting it but nothing.;_Label_Zero
I have to restart my phone to use it.;_Label_Zero
I pay $10 a month and this is the kind of service I get?;_Label_Zero
Unless you purchase the premium version the annoying adds spoil it.;_Label_Zero
You can find so many songs and all good ones.;_Label_Zero
Without the adds definately 5 stars.;_Label_Zero
Quality is excellent.;_Label_Zero
Get annoying emails all the time and the unsubscribe link for them does not work;_Label_Zero
I did love this app but now since the last two updates it keeps shutting down whenever I open up another app.;_Label_Zero
I have a meditation app that I listen to while I play Spotify, it won't play simultaneously anymore with any other app please fix.;_Label_Zero
I have been a subscriber to the premium service for over a year now and had the free service for a year prior to that I am getting very frustrated, I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times the problem is getting worse!;_Label_Zero
Great selection of music and easy to find just what you want;_Label_Zero
Loading circle is not music.;_Label_Zero
Seems like all apps eventually turn to junk.;_Label_Zero
When I'm trying  to log in with facebook  a message appears with: I tried to log in from another county  ?? please,  give me support;_Label_Zero
The app won't let me log in.;_Label_Zero
It just constantly says it's logging in but never actually logs in.;_Label_Zero
You guys should bring back the snow on spotify but instead let it be a optional thing and include a rain option;_Label_Zero
The music is so amazing but you need to pay for ad free music;_Label_Zero
None of the others have anything on Spotify!!!!!;_Label_Zero
Love the fact u can customize and listen offline ur play lists...also the up to date music you can Save instead of liking.;_Label_Zero
when your playing a game on your android or apple device you've got the audio for the game over the top of the music.;_Label_Comp
fix the search bar ... keeps disappearing.;_Label_Zero
Love it so much fun to listen to!;_Label_Zero
It was good but I thought you could make your own playlist;_Label_Zero
The app is constantly telling me I am offline when I have Internet to be able to listen to music.;_Label_Zero
it constantly freezes on me and kicks me out of the app.;_Label_Zero
I like listening to the music on here but I am getting upset about the updates and problems that app is having.;_Label_Zero
I downloaded this, expecting a decent music streaming service like Spotify Desktop.;_Label_Zero
First, you can only play songs in Shuffle play.;_Label_Zero
But then, you end up listening soley to 'Suggested Songs' and won't let you skip more than a couple, so you're stuck listening to Bubblegum pop instead of the Classical music you wanted to listen to.;_Label_Zero
I can just use the browser version on my phone anyway.;_Label_Comp
The least user friendly app I've ever used;_Label_Zero
Fantastic love this app well worth up gradeing;_Label_Zero
Stops after 10 sec playback in a sudden with all tracks.;_Label_Zero
Turns out I had to clear all cache and memory in order to make it run again.;_Label_Zero
I loved the Spotify app until the recent updates.;_Label_Zero
The system is very slow now and screen touches lag.;_Label_Zero
Very disappointed thinking of cancelling subscription;_Label_Zero
you can play your favorite music for free.;_Label_Zero
Anyone else getting it?;_Label_Zero
App will not load;_Label_Zero
I like it but the stations are not very good;_Label_Zero
While the app works great for the most part, the lock screen player rarely shows up and when it does usually only the skip button works, while the play/pause button does not.;_Label_Zero
After my 7 days ended I couldn't play my music;_Label_Zero
Your login is horrible.;_Label_Zero
I want to use my email not username.;_Label_Zero
Trying to set an account up but says my email account is allready taken by someone.;_Label_Zero
Sort it out;_Label_Zero
There is a bug with the ads and the app will stay stuck on the ad and not play it.;_Label_Zero
Have to restart my phone to listen to music again;_Label_Zero
It doesn't really count as free if you cant choose which song you want to listen to.;_Label_Zero
Also you cant really open that menu for a song because the slider gets in the way.;_Label_Zero
Spotify used to display on my lock screen so I didn't have to unlock my phone just to change songs.;_Label_Zero
This was really useful during workouts.;_Label_Zero
Great you should get it;_Label_Zero
Remove the forced shuffle thing ??;_Label_Zero
When I open this app it would fc then I would  open it again after that no issues I just have to do it every single day;_Label_Zero
when I put my email in it didn't accept it.;_Label_Zero
It was all right but after like 30 days asked me to buy premium pack after every song ??;_Label_Zero
That's all.;_Label_Zero
You pay to be a member but once your not a paying member, all the downloads you have they don't play as anymore.;_Label_Zero
So cool have to listen to music;_Label_Zero
My favorite music app.;_Label_Zero
Great sound quality and great diversity of music.;_Label_Zero
With the new update it doesn't have the thing at the bottom that shows the album artwork.;_Label_Zero
You can't skip to a certain part of the songs and you have to change songs manually.;_Label_Zero
Please fix this.;_Label_Zero
Used to work just fine.;_Label_Zero
Recently, I can have excellent WiFi connection and full bars and it won't load any online songs.;_Label_Zero
Please fix this.;_Label_Zero
Disapointed cause I got a new phone and now it will not work LG 22 c on lollipop 5.0;_Label_Comp
Becuase you guys have Dirty Work!!!;_Label_Zero
Can someone tell me if there's an app like Spotify that actually works?;_Label_Zero
One that preferably doesn't say 'no internet connection' when I definitely am connected to the internet.;_Label_Zero
But its not better than soundcloud;_Label_Zero
How do I make it bill my at&t account?;_Label_Zero
I want premiem but I don't have a credit card.;_Label_Zero
need answer please;_Label_Zero
...but with the constant updates, now it just crashes.;_Label_Zero
Love the fact I can listen to whatever I want ANY time.....Update.;_Label_Zero
Changed the 5 stars to 2 because they still have not updated the Android app to include the running  app.;_Label_Zero
It was all good until I had to pay every month.;_Label_Zero
Like i aint doing that!;_Label_Zero
I understand you need a way to get more money and for the artists to not get cheated in a way.;_Label_Zero
But i hate it that i cant find an app where i can get free music!;_Label_Zero
Can only play shufle;_Label_Zero
Best music app out there, but they should really bring the price down!;_Label_Zero
Wish you could cast;_Label_Zero
I love being able to access millions of songs and creating my own playlist.;_Label_Zero
You can't choose which device the music is playing from anymore;_Label_Zero
Spotify used to be king when it came to features.;_Label_Zero
Still no Chromecast support.;_Label_Zero
Also, Android wear support is extremely basic.;_Label_Zero
PlayStation support is amazing however.;_Label_Zero
Hope we get wear support soon.;_Label_Zero
This app is great In all but please add a timer or sleep timer.;_Label_Zero
When I sleep I live to listen to music and it would be better if a timer was added.;_Label_Zero
Please add a feature search.;_Label_Zero
It takes 10 minutes to load the music when I'm on fast Wi-Fi and have no trouble doing any other activities.;_Label_Zero
If I didn't have all my play lists created I could cancel immediately because the service is so bad.;_Label_Zero
Also, for some reason it un-downloaded my downloaded play lists.;_Label_Zero
My Grandkids Loved it;_Label_Zero
It's great but there are so many new songs out and they aren't there but overall it's awesome!!!;_Label_Zero
Since the last update this app has given me nothing but trouble, it freezes constantly and sometimes won't even open.;_Label_Zero
When I finally get it to work I cant use any other apps on my phone as it actually causes them to freeze also (they work fine when Spotify isnt on)!;_Label_Comp
The title says most of it, the search feature (If not instantly failing) will take an eternity to load results.;_Label_Zero
Also will occasionally freeze the Galaxy S5.;_Label_Zero
I loved this app and used it all the time but was horrified this AM while listening to a random playlist I chose called Morning Buzz.;_Label_Zero
One of the songs by artist MariKKKopa was clearly hateful angry racist ranting.;_Label_Zero
I will no longer be a happy follower of playlists unless this artist is REMOVED.;_Label_Zero
I clicked on a song and it plays a whole different song;_Label_Zero
Just wish you could crate ringtones;_Label_Zero
With Premium acc is good, but if you don't have Premium, app is very horrible.;_Label_Zero
Really bad whenever it's time to play an Ad.;_Label_Zero
I will almost always have to restart the app.;_Label_Zero
Good sound quality.;_Label_Zero
Still needs updating with.more songs/artists bit other than that it's great!;_Label_Zero
It's cool has ALL my favorite artist;_Label_Zero
I love it one thin I think the should add is a tempo/speed thing so you can listen at different speeds that would be cool;_Label_Zero
My search bar isn't working.;_Label_Zero
I just noticed it today.;_Label_Zero
Other than that, I love spotify.;_Label_Zero
I just need the search bar issue resolved.;_Label_Zero
Love it to bits ( Premium) but I have to restart my phone everytime;_Label_Zero
Spotify is a great app;_Label_Zero
Tired of shuffle playing;_Label_Zero
It is dead boaring;_Label_Zero
The only thing bad is atlest give unlimited skips and play when ever you want to people who don't have premium;_Label_Zero
Good music display and audio!;_Label_Zero
WAY better then you Pandora.;_Label_Zero
It doesnt let you pick the song u want to listen to its just always on shuffle and I hate it;_Label_Zero
I was able to find all the old albums I used to have and listen to my 80's music again.;_Label_Zero
How come you can't have spotify at a certain age?;_Label_Zero
All you just do is listen to music.;_Label_Zero
Since the new update, I cannot see the album art of local files on my phone;_Label_Zero
I really want to download it but it said stopped pls fix it I think its a great music  downloader I'll give five if u guys fix it;_Label_Zero
Where's the search button?;_Label_Zero
Just the ads need to go;_Label_Zero
Please fix this!;_Label_Zero
The app tells me it is offline when I try to listen to music on my network data connection.;_Label_Zero
I have checked the settings to enable online use but this doesn't make any difference.;_Label_Zero
If I stop the app completely and login again it works until I stop using the app, then it just goes offline again.;_Label_Zero
I'm going to cancel my Spotify membership as it is a waste of money because the app doesn't work.;_Label_Zero
And yes, I've tried reinstalling it.;_Label_Zero
They could make us pay before we get it;_Label_Zero
Since my phone updated to lolipop the app crash each time I want to start it.;_Label_Zero
How do I search songs now???????;_Label_Zero
Wont accept my credentials;_Label_Zero
Spotify is great, i can listen to all the music I want away from the Internet.;_Label_Zero
The price is a bit much, but if you think about it, it's less than buying a cd a month;_Label_Zero
Loved it so much.I can get all my favorite songs from my favorite artists.;_Label_Zero
Previous version was great, now it takes like 30 seconds to open!!!;_Label_Comp
Please fix that or let us downgrade to previous update.;_Label_Zero
I can't search and add new songs,fix that!;_Label_Zero
It is a whole new,and better,alternative to Pandora.;_Label_Zero
If I'm playing it in my car on Bluetooth sometimes the song will stop.;_Label_Zero
Also when playing in my car if I go into maps and have that on the screen eventually spotify stops playing and exits and I have to go back into the app again.;_Label_Zero
Please fix these given I'm paying every month and not getting what I paid for.;_Label_Zero
Include lyrics option please!;_Label_Zero
I cant opem it.;_Label_Zero
It someumes freezes my phone.;_Label_Zero
And then tells me spotify stopped running;_Label_Zero
How to search?I don't find it.;_Label_Zero
Only problem I have with the app is the inability to download music to an SD card, as I have limited internal storage space.;_Label_Zero
All you have to do is lock the music from being transferred off the SD card, similar to iTunes.;_Label_Zero
Please fix this, I love Spotify and would love to continue using it.;_Label_Zero
I can listen to any song I like or want to hear I thank it is great;_Label_Zero
Love the music;_Label_Zero
Ps3 trouble when i use the ps3 version it says i am already linked and therefore tells me to go to ps3 or sony server etc but not surewhat this all means;_Label_Zero
Sometimes the search menu just disappears;_Label_Zero
Would rate it 5 stars but when i use wifi it constantly says I'm not connected to the interent, when i am.;_Label_Zero
Please fix this, i hate using my data to download the songs i want.;_Label_Zero
C'mon everythings on shuffle, random music pops up and ads.;_Label_Zero
I guess the only free part is the uninstall button.;_Label_Zero
Thanks a lot Spotify.;_Label_Zero
Even advertisement is not to frequent while enjoying my awesome Playlist.;_Label_Zero
Great job Spotify...lata.;_Label_Zero
This app really awesome i can listen whatever music i want!;_Label_Zero
Every time I go on I can't browse or do anything that requires a connection.;_Label_Zero
I am fully connected to wifi and offline mode is off.;_Label_Zero
Will cancel if not fixed very soon...;_Label_Zero
Works great for working out and premium is beyond worth it!!!!;_Label_Zero
