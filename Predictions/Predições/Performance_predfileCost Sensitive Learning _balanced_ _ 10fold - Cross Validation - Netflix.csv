To be honest I would tell everybody I know to get it to complete their movie experience!!!!;_Label_Zero
out of no where the video will freeze up for a few minutes then after that it will force close.;_Label_Perf
awesome app but first you have to log out and in but still awesome app you should get it it is great;_Label_Zero
I enjoy the service and they have an excellent selection and wide variety of movies and shows.;_Label_Zero
I haven't really used this yet, I have been just streaming free shows and movies from my kindle fire.;_Label_Zero
We shall see.;_Label_Zero
i love netflex it is.awesome it works VERY well i love.it i watch all my.movies.nd.shows on this.its better than red box or hulu but tht is my opinion;_Label_Zero
I got a Roku1 and watched a couple things on my 50 inch screen TV.;_Label_Zero
I checked the internet connection, which was fine and it restarted ok.;_Label_Perf
Have watched tons of things on my fire taplet and my Iphone.;_Label_Zero
I'm rather disappointed in that I cannot arrange and rearrange my queue.;_Label_Zero
This app is basically allowing the user to stream a movie.;_Label_Zero
i dont know why i keep the service honestly.;_Label_Zero
i am constantly frustrated by the lack of material available on the streaming plan... ESPECIALLY when it says that the disc is availablce!;_Label_Perf
i have an idea... how bout you burn that onto your servers and make it available?;_Label_Zero
the lack of availability on streaming doesn't make me want to upgrade, it just pisses me off.;_Label_Zero
Device limitations, I pay for it and don't even watch it because it has nothing I like on it.;_Label_Zero
My daughter started to pay for it because I was going to discontinue it, so if that tells you anything.......You can only use two devices at a time and that really sucks.;_Label_Zero
I love the season of TV shows they have.;_Label_Zero
Am watching Supernatural that has 7 seasons.;_Label_Zero
They keep it updated.;_Label_Perf
There is 7 seasons and the show just got done with season 8.;_Label_Zero
And there are alot of shows that had only 1 season.;_Label_Perf
Alot of choices!!;_Label_Zero
Reasonable price for streaming!!;_Label_Zero
Was a decent app now no video and frequent errors.;_Label_Zero
This must be fixed soon or I will  end my service;_Label_Zero
even if you reinstall it doesn't work.;_Label_Perf
I prefer to join periodically rather then continuous to allow them to build up a new supply of movies.;_Label_Zero
Netflix is great you can watch movies on the with your phone, kindle fire or your computer , laptop or just sitting at home!;_Label_Zero
It's the best thing you can buy because every one in the family can watch what they like.;_Label_Zero
It sometimes 'hangs' and I have had to shut down and restart my Kindle Fire.;_Label_Perf
I do like being able to control the volume from within the app.;_Label_Zero
I also like the 10 second 'rewind' button.;_Label_Zero
I enjoy watching all the genres available.;_Label_Zero
One can choose from documentaries, TV shows both old and current, movies and biographies.;_Label_Zero
My grandchild loves to watch her shows and I can catch my favorites without commercial interruption.;_Label_Zero
I have a Netflix subscription for home use and found that when I want to catch up on an old television series or movie, it was great to have it on my Kindle and take it to the gym and watch it while I'm on the treadmill.;_Label_Zero
If I pause a movie and come back to it later then it only plays sound and a black screen.;_Label_Zero
To fix the problem I have to uninstall the app...turn the kindle off...turn back on...then reinstall the app.;_Label_Zero
If one of my children aren't watching something on their Kindle Fires with Netflix, then my husband or I are.;_Label_Zero
This app allows you to quickly and easily access Netflix content that is available for streaming.;_Label_Zero
My kids have all but given up on watching television, as they can watch what they want when they want on Netflix.;_Label_Zero
Thanks to this app I can watch Netflix on my Pandigital tablet.;_Label_Zero
It did not come preloaded like it is on other tablets, I am very happy with this app.;_Label_Zero
It was amazing and I was able to contol it just like on television.;_Label_Zero
i can not wait to watch my next program.;_Label_Zero
Great having all the movies you like at the top of your fingers.;_Label_Zero
One price and watch all you want.;_Label_Zero
this is by far easier than Amazon PRime  interms of streaming options ie we can stream at .3 gb/hour versus HD ONLY at 1-2.3 GB.;_Label_Zero
I have netflix on my phone and computer but now that i have it on my kindle fire it gives me a reason to workout longer at the gym!;_Label_Zero
I like Netflix but I wish they would submit less violent movies.;_Label_Zero
I enjoy comedy and mystery but not as much violence.;_Label_Zero
We have used Netflix for a couple of years but just recently started watching it on our portable devices since it can be watched on anything with an internet connection.Internet speeds do not have to be as fast with Netflix as they do with Amazon Prime.;_Label_Perf
The app worked generally as expected the first launch.But today it required that I log in again (why I was logged out is unknown) then crashes after a login timeout.;_Label_Perf
Has new movie best seletion of TV shows update everyday  and the best thing of is I can see it any where;_Label_Zero
There are so many choices for everyone's liking and the the fact you can watch as many as you want for a very small monthly fee is awesome and you can watch from just about any device where you have internet.;_Label_Zero
Anyone who loves watching movies or tv series should subscribe.;_Label_Zero
They don't add any NEW movies.;_Label_Zero
I would like to see more new movies.;_Label_Zero
It continues to give me constant error messages then restarts my browser.;_Label_Zero
I hats it.;_Label_Zero
Good catalogue and good service.;_Label_Zero
I should not do this review because I haven't used this yet.;_Label_Perf
I may decide not to use it because I don't want 2 netflix bills!;_Label_Zero
A great alternative to paying the high prices for pay channels.;_Label_Zero
I can pick and choose what I want to watch and when I want to watch it.;_Label_Zero
Works great, looks great (with decent signal, of course).;_Label_Zero
If you are having issues with the app on kindle fire then post your review on the kindle fire app version!;_Label_Zero
Netflix has a huge variety of programs to choose from right at your finger tips and at an amazing cost.;_Label_Zero
The only thing we tend to forget about is not being in a wi-fi spot!;_Label_Zero
It's nice to be able to start watching on my Kindle something I stopped watching on my TV.;_Label_Zero
sound is in sync.;_Label_Zero
they updated it so now the grey tab bar is gone.;_Label_Zero
video quality is great it just takes a second.;_Label_Perf
This app allows you to bring netflix where ever you go!;_Label_Zero
The videos load very fast and look good!;_Label_Perf
The sound is great depending on the device you have.;_Label_Zero
The only downside to this app is you do need to acess the internet to watch the videos.;_Label_Zero
I down loaded it by mistake.;_Label_Zero
I will read it next time.;_Label_Zero
netflix sucks and isn't the best for a kindle fire.you shouldn't waste your money on it.trust me!!!!!!!;_Label_Zero
My daughter has this on her Nabi Tablet and it keeps her busy after homework time of course.;_Label_Zero
Lots of things to choose from for her to watch,;_Label_Zero
When i first reviewed Netflix on the kindle fire i gave it only 3 stars because of serious audio issues with the player but they have since patched it and it works perfectly now, they even got rid of the black bar at the bottom of the screen...so good job Netflix!;_Label_Perf
Scrolling through movies is a chore as sometimes the row won't scroll when you touch it and once in awhile it says cannot retrieve info and will make me log back in.;_Label_Zero
Knock on wood it always accepts my password and I am back up and running.;_Label_Zero
Sometimes the choice of movies leave a great deal to be desired but now that I have found the Korean movies, especially the TV series by Studio 15, we have some very fine story lines and acting.;_Label_Zero
They are movies you can watch with the family and not be embarassed.;_Label_Zero
Chong Park's music is delightful.;_Label_Zero
I've had Netflix for many years, now that they are producing their own original content, it has only gotten better.;_Label_Zero
I would love it if they had a little more updated movies;_Label_Zero
I chose to rate Netflix with 5 stars because I enjoy the varied options to choose between TV shows (especially those out of the UK and Austrailia), movies that build on faith and values which can be watched with any member of the family, and the ease of use.I recommend it to those who tend to those who prefer less sex and violence.;_Label_Zero
I also recommend it to those who enjoy a good movie/program with a message for the good.;_Label_Zero
For the price you cant beat it you can watch just about anything although some things I looked for were not available.;_Label_Zero
There are no commercials and that is a plus over Hulu, but it doesn't have enough recognizable movies.;_Label_Perf
I can watch TV shows that missed, but not all of them.;_Label_Perf
It does stream movies smoother if you have a slower modem, unlike Hulu.;_Label_Zero
I still ended up getting a faster modem.;_Label_Zero
I bought a cheap set of earphones with a 3' cord and now I can walk around anywhere my WiFi reaches while watching what I choose.This added a whole new dimension to my Kindle Fire.;_Label_Zero
its great app its very useful you can watch your favorite movies and TV shows at your disposal its something the whole family can use;_Label_Zero
It is cheaper than Netflix and hey... you get free shipping on most of the things you buy!;_Label_Zero
I used to have both, but I found that both services have about the same movies.;_Label_Zero
It keeps my kids happy while I work.;_Label_Perf
Very little loading time and great picture;_Label_Perf
The only issue I am having is the audio is a little off from the video.;_Label_Zero
Picture quality is great, and I am not having the issue with the border staying on the screen.;_Label_Perf
Almost all of the movie and t.v. show options for the adults like me with an array of action, suspense, and at rare occasions the horror movie fix option is always there, too.;_Label_Zero
What the best part is the customer ratings that a video store never was able to provide as well as the Netflix option to rate movies and then have recommended films and shows for the future entertainment.;_Label_Zero
Also there are plenty of children's movies and programs except with my disappointment no Star Wars materials.;_Label_Zero
Overall, the best area now that will give the best deals for t.v. and movies.;_Label_Zero
May go ahead and STOP my cable and just use neflix.;_Label_Zero
Great selection, and easy to stream to ALL my machines;_Label_Zero
full seasonsgood genres, I would give 5 stars exceptthey are a little behind on getting some of the latest seasons;_Label_Zero
Now I can watch my favorite shows on the run as long as I have WiFi minor issues with picture at times might be operator error;_Label_Perf
I love all the options you have to pick from!;_Label_Zero
To me a free trial does NOT involve my credit card.;_Label_Zero
A free trial means that I try it for free and if I like it I THEN provide my credit card.;_Label_Zero
I'm enjoying all the excellent series that Netflix has and the time saved by eliminating commercials or browsing thru the TV schedule.;_Label_Zero
I only wanted this App on my phone to check my account, etc.;_Label_Zero
I did not want a free trial, as I already have an account and do no streaming, just DVD's.;_Label_Zero
Now I can't get a response from Netflix and will probably be paying double for something I don't even use.;_Label_Zero
"i always go on Netflix and watch tv shows and movies sometimes it buffers but i still LOVE IT SO MUCH&#60;3";_Label_Zero
Allows to add and delete streaming movies and shows to list.;_Label_Zero
Quality is what it should be & you need it(the app)to play shows from netflix.;_Label_Zero
I am unfamiliar with how to use this app and what it offers and instructions on how ti activeate it.;_Label_Zero
Very convenient can use it on my kindleEnjoy the tv series options .;_Label_Zero
I can watch what I want to while others are watching what they want;_Label_Zero
Particularly for the HD Kindle, this is like having a movie theater right in the palm of your hands.;_Label_Zero
"Every once in a while, I have issues getting this to load on my kindle; shutting it down and restarting does not fix the problem.";_Label_Perf
Frustrating because I'm paying for the subscription to Netflix.;_Label_Zero
I love that I can stream movies and certain tv shows when I feel like watching them.;_Label_Zero
Or catching up on tv shows that I haven't been able to watch.;_Label_Perf
I have a kindle fire HD and I didn't want to buy or rent any movies from prime... so they finally have it for kindle.;_Label_Zero
i tryed  and tryed to get my app store to work and all needed to do is put the right password for my amzon account and presto, the download worked.;_Label_Perf
Anytime i want to catch a breather from my work on campus I pull out my kindle and watch a few tv shows or a movie.;_Label_Zero
I think this app is cool because u get to pick a favorote T.V show.;_Label_Zero
and watch it.;_Label_Zero
Definitely happy I'm able to watch Netflix on my Kindle Fire!;_Label_Zero
Netflix is wat i recommend to all the movie lovers out there  i watch movies on Netflix every day with the best picture quality ever;_Label_Zero
I can choose my evening movies while away from my TV.;_Label_Zero
If you have a Netflix account, you've gotta get this app, It is free, and you can watch whatever Netflix offers wherever you happen to be.;_Label_Zero
They embedded a volume bar into the app which is a nice upgrade.;_Label_Zero
However the video and audio are still choppy.;_Label_Zero
i would have fixed that before making embedded volume a priority.;_Label_Zero
Newer releases sooner, to long between blu-ray release and streaming.;_Label_Zero
Should be able to stream and not wait two to three years.;_Label_Zero
I spend a lot of time watching movies or old tv shows, so any type of movie/tv app rocks for me.;_Label_Zero
Netflix has been the old standby and got me through quite awhile of basic cable and spent many hours of watching Dr. Who.;_Label_Zero
"Excellent, very easy to find what you want and I think the &#34;films like ......&#34; that shows movies or programmes similar to the ones you've watched is a great idea.";_Label_Zero
Nor do I own a Boob tube (tv).;_Label_Zero
By this time I would have thought Netfix would have created a more robust app for viewing their content.;_Label_Zero
It's look and feel is very basic.;_Label_Zero
What I dont like is that I cant update my DVD queue from the mobile app.;_Label_Zero
I llike the new profile management, but I it needs to be expanded to provide better parental controls.;_Label_Zero
This app fulfills every promise it makes and has a convenient user interface that is similar to the actual Netflix website.;_Label_Zero
I can count on one hand how many times it has had to buffer even though many other apps on the Kindle move slowly.;_Label_Zero
They do not put enough new movies as often as I would like.;_Label_Zero
I do love the price and the TV show selections.;_Label_Zero
Yeah again, only was able to watch on computer so now it awesome to catch my shows elsewhere as long as i can connect;_Label_Zero
User friendly app that loads quickly and well and is easy to navigate and find what you need.;_Label_Zero
Just use a micro HDMI cable to connect it to your big screen TV and plug your phone charger in and enjoy.;_Label_Zero
Plus with Metro PCS I have an unlimited 4G data plan so I don't have to worry about being ripped off for streaming.;_Label_Zero
It runs ok but can freeze or load very slow at times.;_Label_Perf
The interface is intuitive and just adds another mobile device to continue watching my favorite shows.;_Label_Zero
I was slightly unenthusiastic at first,reading all the negative reviews.;_Label_Zero
Video stream was very good and at my home DSL wireless,as good as a Dvd player.the bottom tool bar get minimized and it is not annoying at all.Overall a good app for netflix movies.;_Label_Zero
I don't have free internet and pay by the KB so can't use Netflix but thought this might offer an alternative.;_Label_Zero
Good way to watch TV.;_Label_Zero
You can choose shows from the menu and netflix tries to predict what shows you will like based on previous ratings.;_Label_Zero
I probably haven't ranked enough shows because Netflix has no clue what I'd like to watch.;_Label_Zero
The layout is really good but the functionality is awful on the transformer infinity.;_Label_Zero
It is so slow that it barely will scroll the screen.;_Label_Perf
Watching a movie is blurry for a while and clears up most of the time.;_Label_Zero
I had been holding off on NetFlix for a while.;_Label_Zero
Now that I have it I barely watch TV anymore.;_Label_Zero
Better than the bargain-bin On-Demand choices I have with my local cable provider.;_Label_Zero
i had to pay 10 dallor a mouth !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;_Label_Zero
please sew them.;_Label_Zero
sync issues with audio and severe video lag.;_Label_Zero
I wonder if this is done on purpose to force consumers to pay for the premier service;_Label_Zero
We have a special needs son that can watch appropriate television anytime he wants to and the availability of it makes it a terrific reward system.;_Label_Zero
We also have a typical  child that enjoys a wide variety of television and movies.;_Label_Zero
Netflix has so many free choices for TV shows and movies.;_Label_Zero
They keep track of what you've watched and, even after a lot of time, you can start your show where you left off.;_Label_Zero
So much easier to navigate than Amazon.;_Label_Zero
I struggle to find what I want on Amazon and usually give up.;_Label_Zero
On Netflix, there is a list of what I've watched recently plus I can just type it in a bar and it comes up if they have it.;_Label_Zero
It is so frustrating to navigate Amazon to even get to their videos what's more find one to watch.;_Label_Zero
Recently, I have been bringing my Fire to work so I can watch some shows while on my lunch break.;_Label_Perf
I sat down today to continue watching my show when I opened the Netflix app, or I should say that I tried to open the app, but a connection error popped up.;_Label_Perf
I then checked other apps, they are working properly, so I decided to delete and reinstall the app.;_Label_Zero
I am not sure who to place the blame on since the app was working perfectly up until today.;_Label_Zero
this is the best app but it's a little fuzzy and stops every now and then it's awesome and that is my review;_Label_Zero
the reason i don't give it 5 stars is only because i want even more movies right after they are out of theaters;_Label_Zero
YES, I LIKE THAT I CAN WATCH MOST ANYTHING I WANT INSTANTLY, AND CAN GET DVD'S QUICKLY IF THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR INSTANT WATCHING.;_Label_Zero
THE ONLY REASON FOR NOT GIVING IT 5 STARS IS THAT I GOT HOOKED ON THE SHOW REVOLUTION, AND I HAVE WATCHED ALL THE EPISODES IN SEASON 1, BUT SEASON 2 IS NOT AVAILABLE YET!;_Label_Zero
I LOVE THIS APP, don't believe those people who say it has terrible video quality,and ext.;_Label_Zero
I hats this app!;_Label_Zero
everytime I decide to watch a movie, I can't find it on Netflix.;_Label_Zero
I don't typically watch stuff that should be hard to find either.;_Label_Zero
I love Netflix streaming and it works fine everywhere else.;_Label_Perf
And the other video apps work fine on the Fire.;_Label_Perf
But Netflix currently has an audio sync problem that makes watching anything extremely difficult.;_Label_Zero
The only fix I've found is to watch subtitled films so you won't notice so much.01/09/12 - Update: It's fixed.;_Label_Perf
Works great and the selection of Netflix is still the best.;_Label_Perf
This was a smart purchase that has proven to be WONDERFUL for traveling!I did appreciate that I was permitted a free trial because I was leary of if it actually worked...or if the movies were oooooooold/boring or were of poor quality.;_Label_Perf
