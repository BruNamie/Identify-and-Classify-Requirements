The only downside for me ( using a sony experia E1) is that my media saves to my phone not my sd card n there's no option to change it like there wae with the older version on my blackberry.;_Label_Zero
All required issues have been resolved... Really looking forward to have whatsapp calling working...;_Label_Zero

I wl gv full stars when it tkes less time for download;_Label_Zero
I'm not gettig the service of free call after updating it if I didn't got it soon I'm surely going to stop using whatsapp and uninstall it;_Label_Zero
When someone tries to view profile picture then it lags and full picture is not displayed even after scrolling down.;_Label_Zero
Which was very smooth until last update.;_Label_Zero

I cant download need SMS Plan and im using temporary phone still cant download WhatsApp;_Label_Zero
No calling option...;_Label_Zero
Just an idea if you maybe can make it happen dev.;_Label_Zero
I'm thinking that it would be better if you can expand the chat list.;_Label_Zero
Now, it only show 2 lines of information (line1: name, line2: last message).;_Label_Zero
See if you can make it to 3 lines of information (line1: name, line2: person's status, line3: last message).;_Label_Zero
I think it would be great, since it would be great to know what people thinking and start the talking based on that.;_Label_Zero
Nice  for chatting;_Label_Zero
Its an awsome app... but it would be an more awsome if it had callin feature....am eagerly waiting for it;_Label_Zero
I've updated few days ago.;_Label_Zero
There is something wrong with this update.;_Label_Zero
I'm not getting notifications properly.;_Label_Zero
Its very nice that it keeps people in touch who are far away from each other but it is also a distraction from other things !!;_Label_Zero
Permission should be asked before downloading media instead of downloading by itself.;_Label_Zero
And if larger files could be transferred like over 50 mb then it would be great;_Label_Zero
This app Is  still installing;_Label_Zero
You need to prefix 0 to dial a phone number if it is an inter state call.;_Label_Zero
But then the contact won't show up in Whatsapp unless u add +91.;_Label_Zero
plz add stickers also like hike.;_Label_Zero
just updated n got whatsapp calling option...called thru wifi but unable to hear second party....then i received one call i answered still same prob....i checked with my friends here in uae and india all r facing same prob plz fix it.;_Label_Zero
Just stick to your whatsapp because it's really cool.;_Label_Zero

Great chat block and talk hu;_Label_Zero
Plz...........download it fast;_Label_Zero
Whatever you guys do whatsapp + stays better unless you cooperate with whatsapp + team or at least put all whatsapp + features and options in your app...if it wasn't necessary for my work I wouldn't have downloaded the normal whatsapp since its not rich in options like its 3rd party brother brother was;_Label_Zero
Like the new calling option  but a ridiculous  place to put the button as keep pressing by mistake when trying to send  a photo or video!;_Label_Zero
Needs repositioning ASAP!;_Label_Zero
kmk dah install whatsapp...tapi xpat;_Label_Zero
